MES Exercise 3.2

This is a simple program to simulate the workings of READ, WRITE and ERASE commands to a SPI Flash Memory (Winbond W25Q80DV).

Currently the program supports a memory table of up to 64KB, which would be 1 Bock of the memory chip. Each block has 16 Sectors of 4KB.

In order to visualize the operations to memory, it is useful to use a smaller memory table.
